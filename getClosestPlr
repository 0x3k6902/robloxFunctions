--// Ill leave my implementation of how i used it in esp below

local closestPlayer = GetClosestPlayer()

--// Esp Example

local closestPlayer = GetClosestPlayer()
Box.Color = (closestPlayer == v) and Color3.new(1, 0, 0) or Color3.new(1, 1, 1)

]]

-- Note: Using this in esp was all i did if u plan to use this elsewhere i suggest updating the source a little bit, when i used it in esp i didnt add a maxrange or FOV for it so someones box is always highlighted even if ur mouse isnt near a player someone will be highlighted u can adjust this easily though and isnt even a big issue, i worded this terribly cos its dumb to explain i just dont want discord dms asking me why i left a 'bug' in it
